# java-ddd-skeleton

This is a Java skeleton project developed while taking some [CodelyTV](https://github.com/codelytv) courses and based on
my own experience.

Here, I apply different concepts such as:

* SOLID principles
* Hexagonal Architecture / Ports & Adapters Architecture
* Test Pyramid
* Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
* Event-Driven Architecture
* Domain-Driven Design
